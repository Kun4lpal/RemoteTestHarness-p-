In order to run the GUI, perform the following steps:


I would suggest you to first check toSend and SavedFiles folder in Repository as well as TServer folder and delete any temp files available.
The savedFIles and toSend folder should only contains DLL files required for testing. 


1) Go to button definition for sendmessage_click and connect_click in the windowsXaml.cs file and uncomment the instructions inside them.
2) Delete the text highlighted in the .cs files from 119 to 155 from client1 and 94 to 133 from client 2 window.xaml.cs File. 
3) You can see the comment : DELETE THE FOLLOWING TEXT there. 
4) NOTE PEER-COMM FOLDER IN PROJECT MAIN DIR IS THE CLIENT 1 MAIN DIR.
5) TO CHECK THE GETLOG FUNCION, remove line 91 and 73 from client 1 and client 2 window.xaml.cs respectively.
